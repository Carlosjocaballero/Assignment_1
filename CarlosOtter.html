      With long, sleek, streamlined bodies and webbed feet, otters are born
      swimmers. They are found in waterways on every continent except Australia
      and Antarctica. They are often seen floating on their backs. Their thick
      fur traps air and makes them buoyant. Unfortunately, the fur is highly
      coveted, and otters have been hunted almost to extinction in many places.
