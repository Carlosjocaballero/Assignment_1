      The African Wildcat is the ancestor of the Domestic cat. This species of
      cat is widely distributed and has a wide variety of coat colors to help it
      blend into its environment. Because of that, theWildcat was originally
      classified as 3 distinct species, but today they are referred to as one
      race with 3 subspecies. One other subspecies, F.s. grampia of Scotland, is
      no longer considered a separate subspecies but a member of F.s.
      silvestris, although some authors will make reference to it.
