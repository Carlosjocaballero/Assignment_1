            With long, sleek, streamlined bodies and webbed feet, otters are
            born swimmers. They are found in waterways on every continent except
            Australia and Antarctica. They are often seen floating on their
            backs. Their thick fur traps air and makes them buoyant.
            Unfortunately, the fur is highly coveted, and otters have been
            hunted almost to extinction in many places.

          <p class="animal-description">
            The African Wildcat is the ancestor of the Domestic cat. This
            species of cat is widely distributed and has a wide variety of coat
            colors to help it blend into its environment. Because of that,
            theWildcat was originally classified as 3 distinct species, but
            today they are referred to as one race with 3 subspecies. One other
            subspecies, F.s. grampia of Scotland, is no longer considered a
            separate subspecies but a member of F.s. silvestris, although some
            authors will make reference to it.

          <p class="animal-description">
            Penguins are flightless seabirds that live almost exclusively below
            the equator. Some island-dwellers can be found in warmer climates,
            but most—including emperor, adélie, chinstrap, and gentoo
            penguins—reside in and around icy Antarctica. A thick layer of
            blubber and tightly-packed, oily feathers are ideal for colder
            temperatures.

          </div>
          <p class="animal-description">
            The Bald Eagle has been the national emblem of the United States
            since 1782 and a spiritual symbol for native people for far longer
            than that. These regal birds aren’t really bald, but their
            white-feathered heads gleam in contrast to their chocolate-brown
            body and wings. Look for them soaring in solitude, chasing other
            birds for their food, or gathering by the hundreds in winter. Once
            endangered by hunting and pesticides, Bald Eagles have flourished
            under protection.
